# [TimeManager] by ArVdC
# config.yml
# -----
# *version*
#  This field is automatically checked and refreshed, don't modify it manually.
# -----
# *defTimeUnits*
#  Default time units for the player's command /now, possible values are 'hours' and 'ticks'.
# -----
# *refreshRate*
#  The delay in ticks before actualizing the speed stretch/expand effect.
#  Must be an integer between 2 and 20.
#  Default value is 10 ticks, a too small value can cause server lags, depends on the server resources and the number of maps using a 'speed' modifier.
# -----
# *worldsList*
#  The list of available worlds will be refreshed on server startup. Nether and Ender worlds will be erased if present.
#   *start*
#    Define the time at server startup for the specified world. By default, all worlds will start at tick #0/24000. The tab completion also provides presets like "day", "night", etc. 
#   *speed*
#    Define if the time will be locked, accelerated, decelerated or normally spend for the specified world.
#    Use 0.0 to freeze time, numbers from 0.1 to 0.9 to slow time, 1.0 to get normal speed and numbers from 1.1 to 10.0 to speedup time.
#    Set this value to '24.0' or 'realtime' to make the world time match the real speed time.
#   *sleep*
#    Since sleeping at night make important time changes, it is a priority setting to handle if you want keep sync between maps. Turning this 'false' will cancel sleeping events but still allows the player to enter in a bed and save his position.
#   *sync*
#    Define if the speed distortion method will increase/decrease the world's actual tick (false), or fit the theoretical tick value based on the server one (true).
#    By default, all worlds will start with parameter false. Real time based worlds and frozen worlds do not use this option, on the other hand this will affect even the worlds with a normal speed.
# -----
# *initialTick*
#   *initialTickNb*
#    If it is set to 'false', your server will create a new local temporary reference tick at each startup. If 'true', the tick value will be saved somewhere and used as reference on the next startup.
#   *resetOnStartup*
#    Reset the existing reference tick and save a new one on each server startup by setting it to 'true'.
#    Normal use is to let this on 'false', because it allows you to maintain continuity in worlds timers after the server restarts.
#    In case of working with several servers, at most one of them should turn it true. Set every related servers with an 'false' value will make the reference tick immutable.
#   *useMySqlDb*
#    Enable or not the mySql database (true or false), its provide a possible sharing of the reference server startup tick. See lower for more details.
# -----
# *mySql*
#  Permit to share the initial tick from a reference server to others. The first server using the database will create a reference tick into it.
#  Use this with or without BungeeCord, just set 'initialTick.isHardSaved' and 'initialTick.useMySqlDb' to 'true' in each config.yml file.
#  *host* *port* *ssl* *database* *username* *password*
#    For 'host', use your server ip. (for example: 'localhost' or 'www.minecraftserver.com').
#    Default mySQL port is '3306' but you could change it to match your custom configuration.
#    Default database name is 'timemanager' but you could choose anything else to order it correctly.

# -----
# *updateMsgSrc*
#  Choose a value between 'Bukkit', 'Curse', 'Spigot' or 'Github' to check the update when loading the plugin. Set to 'none', 'false' or '' to avoid verification.
# -----
# *debugMode*
#  Set true to enable colored verbose messages in the console. Useful to understand some mechanisms of this plugin.
