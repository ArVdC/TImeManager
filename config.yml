# [TimeManager] by ArVdC
# config.yml
# -----
# *version*
#  This field is automatically checked and refreshed, don't modify it manually.
# -----
# *defTimeUnits*
#  Default time units for the player's command /now, possible values are 'hours' and 'ticks'.
# -----
# *refreshRate*
#  The delay in ticks before actualizing the speed stretch/expand effect.
#  Must be a integer between 5 and 25.
#  Default value is 10 ticks, a too small value can cause server lags.
# -----
# *worldsList*
#  The list of available worlds will be refreshed on server startup. Nether and Ender worlds will be erased if present.
#   *start*
#    Define the time at server startup for the specified world. By default, all worlds will start at tick #0/24000. The tab completion also provides presets like "day", "night", etc. 
#   *speed*
#    Define if the time will be locked, accelerated, decelerated or normally spend for the specified world.
#    Value must be a decimal number from 0 to 10.
#    Use 0 to freeze time, numbers from 0.1 to 0.9 to slow time, 1 to get normal speed and numbers bigger than 1 to speedup time.
# -----
# *mySql*
#  Permit to share the initial tick from a reference server to others.
#  Use it with or without BungeCord, just set 'refServer' to 'true' in the reference server config.yml file and 'false' in others.
#  WARN: A new reference tick value will create when reference server restart.
#  Set every 'refServer' values to 'false' to make your server time immutable. The first server using the database will create a static reference tick.
#  mySql functions are TODO !
#   *useMySql*
#    Enable the mySql database encoding: true or false (its provide a possible sharing of the reference server startup tick)
#   *refServer*
#    Set a new reference ticks on server startup: true or false (only one of the servers should turn it true)
#   *url* *database* *user* *password*
#    For 'url', use this format: 'mysql://ip:port/' (for example: 'mysql://localhost:3306/')
#    Default database name is 'timemanager' but you could choose anything else.
